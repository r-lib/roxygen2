all' hileth', Hephaiste; didou d'areten te kai olbon.*

1. Roxygen

1.1. Execution

  After installing Roxygen, `R CMD roxygen' or, on Windows, `Rcmd
  roxygen.sh' should be available. Run it above the base of your
  package (hereafter `<package>') like so:

      R CMD roxygen <package>

  or, on Windows:

      Rcmd roxygen.sh <package>

  If `R CMD roxygen' is unavailable, you can invoke Roxygen within R:

      library(roxygen)
      roxygenize('<package>')

  Roxygen creates a package skeleton `<package>.roxygen'; populates
  its `man' directory with Rd files from the source; generates a
  `NAMESPACE'; modifies the Collate field in `DESCRIPTION'; and
  creates call graphs in `inst/doc'.

  You should now be able check, build and install from the new
  directory:

      R CMD check <package>.roxygen

  On Windows, however, you may need to rename the directory.

1.2. TODO

  * Create some automatic method for detecting S3 methods without
    resorting to @method <generic> <class>.

  * Edit the R emacs mode to identify roxygen delimiters when filling,
    etc.

  * Find a reasonable way to document the inner functions of
    make.roclet, etc.

  * Move demos from `sandbox' to `demos'.

  * @defunct, @deprecated, @internal

1.3. BUGS

  * parse.formals doesn't distinguish between no default argument and
    NULL; need a special value?

  * Skeletal Rds are created for assignments without Roxygen-blocks;
    desirable?

  * first.sentence is fooled by infix periods, whereupon it resorts to
    `...'.

  * de.tex doesn't work recursively (i.e. de-TeXs only the top level).

  * `<<' in titles produces a spurious box.

-----------
* Hail, Hephaistos! Grant skill and weal.
