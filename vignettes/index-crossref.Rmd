)
```

This vignette discusses tags that help users finding documentation through cross-references and indexes.

## See also

`@seealso` allows you to point to other useful resources, either on the web (using a url) or to related functions (with a function link like `[function_name()])`.
For `sum()`, this might look like:

```{r}
#' @seealso [prod()] for products, [cumsum()] for cumulative sums, and
#'   [colSums()]/[rowSums()] marginal sums over high-dimensional arrays.
```

## Family

If you have a family of related functions, you can use `@family {family}` to cross-reference each function to every member of the family.
A function can be a member of multiple families.

By default `@family {family}`, will generate the see also text "Other {family}:", so the `@family` name should be plural (i.e., "model building helpers" not "model building helper").

If you want to override default title, you can provide an `rd_family_title` element in a list stored in `man/roxygen/meta.R`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
list(
  rd_family_title = list(aggregations = "Aggregation functions")
)
```

## References

If the object you're documenting has connections to the scientific literature, use `@reference` to provide a citation.

## Aliases

`?` and `help()` look for topic aliases; `?foo` will find any topic that contains the `foo` alias.

roxygen2 generates a default alias for you based on the object you're documenting.
You can add additional aliases with `@aliases alias1 alias2 alias3` or remove default alias with `@aliases NULL`.

## Search

As well as looking in the aliases, `help.search()` and `???` also look in the `@title`, `@keywords`, and `@concept`s tags.

-   `@keywords` adds standard keywords, which must be present in `file.path(R.home("doc"), "KEYWORDS")`.

-   `@concept` adds arbitrary key words or phrases.
    Each `@concept` should contain a single word or phrase.

Generally speaking, `@keywords` and `@concepts` are not terribly useful because most people find documentation using Google, not R's built-in search.

There's one exception: `@keywords internal`.
It's useful because it removes the function from the documentation index; it's useful for functions aimed primarily at other developers, not typical users of the package.

## Back references

The original source location is added as a comment to the second line of each generated `.Rd` file in the following form:

    % Please edit documentation in ...

`roxygen2` tries to capture all locations from which the documentation is assembled.
For code that *generates* R code with Roxygen comments (e.g., the Rcpp package), the `@backref` tag is provided.
This allows specifying the "true" source of the documentation, and will substitute the default list of source files.
Use one tag per source file:

```{r}
#' @backref src/file.cpp
#' @backref src/file.h
```
